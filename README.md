    <h1>Time-Series-analysis-to-Forecast-Champagne-Sales</h1>
    <p>This repository contains a time series analysis project that uses statistical methods to forecast champagne sales. The project is implemented in Python and makes use of the popular data analysis library, Pandas, and the statistical modeling library, Statsmodels.</p>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for this project is the "Champagne Sales" dataset that can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaali96/champagne-sales-dataset). The dataset contains sales figures for champagne in the United States, collected monthly from January 1964 to September 1972.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The methodology used in this project includes time series analysis techniques such as time series decomposition, ARIMA modeling, and seasonal decomposition of time series (STL). These techniques are used to perform a statistical analysis of the data and to make forecasts for future sales.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To run the project, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. The following libraries are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>Numpy</li>
      <li>Matplotlib</li>
      <li>Statsmodels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have the necessary libraries installed, simply run the Jupyter Notebook file in the repository to view the project and its results. You can also modify the code to adjust the analysis and forecasts as desired.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project provides a simple and effective way to perform time series analysis and make forecasts for champagne sales. It demonstrates the power of time series analysis in understanding and predicting trends in sales data, and can serve as a useful tool for businesses looking to optimize their sales and marketing strategies.</p>
